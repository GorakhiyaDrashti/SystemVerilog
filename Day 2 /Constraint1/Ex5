/* Randomized Packet with Payload Constraints
Problem: Create a packet class with the following fields:
systemverilog
Copy code
class packet;
    rand bit [7:0] source, destination;
    rand bit [15:0] payload;
endclass
Constraints:
The source and destination should not be equal.
The payload should always be an even number between 100 and 1000.
Challenge: Write code to randomize the class and display the generated packets.*/
  
  
  
class packet;
    rand bit [7:0] source, destination;
    rand bit [15:0] payload;
  
  constraint c1{
    source != destination;
    payload inside {[100 : 1000]};
    payload %2 ==0;
  }
  
  
  function void display();
    
    $write("source : %0d",source);
    $write("destination : %0d",destination);
    $write("payload : %0d",payload);
    
  endfunction
endclass

module tb;
  packet p;
  initial begin
    p = new();
    assert(p.randomize());
      p.display();
  end
endmodule
