Problem 3: Sequential Event Ordering
Assert that a read signal (rd) is never asserted unless a write signal (wr) was asserted within the last 5 clock cycles.


// Code your testbench here
// or browse Examples
module tb;
  bit clk, wr, rd;
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    wr = 0;
    rd = 0;
  end
    initial begin
     $dumpfile("dump.vcd"); 
      $dumpvars;
      #100;
      $finish();
 end
  always #5 clk = ~clk;
  initial begin
    #10;
    wr = 1;
    #20;
    rd = 1;
  end

  property p1;
    @(posedge clk) rd |-> $past(wr,1) || $past(wr,2) || $past(wr,3) || $past(wr,4) || $past(wr,5);
  endproperty
  
  assert property (p1)
    $info("assertion success $time");
    else
      $error("assertion failed $time");
endmodule
