////Problem: Write a SystemVerilog assertion to verify that a signal req is followed by an ack within 3 cycles, and if it doesn't occur, log a custom error message.


// Code your testbench here
// or browse Examples
module tb;
  reg clk, req, ack;
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    req = 0;
    ack = 0;
  end
    initial begin
     $dumpfile("dump.vcd"); 
      $dumpvars;
      #100;
      $finish();
 end
    
  always #5 clk = ~clk;
  initial begin
    #5 req = 1;
    #40 req = 0;
    #7 req = 1;
    #15 req =0;
    #5 req = 1;
  end
  
  initial begin
    #70 ack = 1;

  end
  
  
  property p1;
    @(posedge clk) req |=> ##[1:3] ack;
  endproperty
  
  assert property (p1)
    $info("assertion success $time");
    else
      $error("assertion failed $time");
endmodule
